This project is a simple Blog API built entirely with Node.js core modules, without using any external frameworks or databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog articles stored in a local JSON file. Each article includes a title, content, author, date, category, tags, and status. The API also supports filtering articles by category, tags, and status, as well as searching through titles, contents, and tags. In addition to article management, the API provides engagement features such as liking and unliking articles, and adding comments with user details and timestamps. All requests can be tested using Thunder Client or Postman, with endpoints for creating new articles using POST, retrieving all or single articles using GET, updating existing articles with PUT, deleting articles with DELETE, liking with a POST to the like route, unliking with a DELETE to the same route, and managing comments through dedicated endpoints. The project demonstrates a strong understanding of core Node.js concepts like the HTTP module, file handling with fs, JSON manipulation, and routing logic without any frameworks.
